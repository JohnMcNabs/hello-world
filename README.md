# hello-world
Introduction to GitHub, so I don't end up lost in a sea of confusion and soda.

This is a test to learn the functionality of this website and all the braches and stuff. I will not write about myself because it isn't in the spirit of this exercise and no one wants to hear another sob story in this coronavirus/riot ridden world of ours (as of the time of these writings).

Also English isn't my native tongue so my grammar might have errors here and there (French is, and certain words have different places in sentences in French).

Thank you.
